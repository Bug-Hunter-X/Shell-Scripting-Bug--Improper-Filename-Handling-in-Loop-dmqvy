This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in shell scripting involving improper handling of filenames containing spaces. The script attempts to iterate through a list of files and perform a processing step on each one. However, if a filename contains spaces, the script will fail due to incorrect word splitting and parameter expansion. The solution provides the corrected script with proper quoting to ensure robust filename handling.
